### VWAP DASHBOARD

uses weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly anchored vwaps to compute a trend scores for 1-40 unique tickers and displays them in a table on screen. it updates per tick and sorts the table from highest to lowest automatically, so it can be very useful at a glance or during times of high volatility to see what is holding up the best.
